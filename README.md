# goPractice
* The starting line of the program should be a package.
* The package main is a special package which contains special function main.
* Main function acts as entry point for the executable programs. No need to call the main function explicitly.

# Static typed language
* Compiler throws an error when data types are used incorrectly. we need to mention the data type. Eg: Java, C++. int a, int b
* Advantages:
* Better performance
* Bugs can often be caught by a compiler
* Better data integrity

# Dynamic typed language
* Compiler does not enforce the type system. Eg: Python, JavaScript.
* Advantages:
* Faster to write code
* less rigid
* shorter learning curve

* Go has a concept of types that is either explicitly declared by a programmer or is inferred by the compiler.
* Go is a statically typed compiled language, that feels like dynamically typed interpreted language.

# Data types
* golang supports different data types such as string, number, boolean, array, slice, map.
  * Number
      * Number includes both integers and float
      * Integers are 2 types. 1. uint (unsigned integers) -> >=0 2. int (signed integers) -> both positive and negative numbers
      * float is of two types. float32 and float64.
      * string occupies 16 bytes.
      * bool takes values true and false. It occupies 1 byte of memory.
